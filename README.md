Analysis of Employee Attrition Based on Public Data
This project was conceived as a learning initiative to apply data analytics skills to a real-world scenarioâ€”understanding the dynamics of employee attrition. Using publicly available employee data, I employed Power BI to dissect various factors potentially influencing attrition rates, including employment duration, gender, salary brackets, age groups, fields of study, departmental differences, and levels of job satisfaction. The project offered a comprehensive exploration of how different variables might correlate with employees' decisions to leave their jobs. Key insights include:
1.	Significance of the Initial Employment Period: The high attrition rate within the first two years suggests the critical importance of this phase in retention efforts.
2.	Gender Differences in Attrition: The analysis revealed a higher attrition rate among male employees, prompting considerations of gender-specific workplace experiences.
3.	Compensation's Role: Lower salary brackets correlated with higher attrition, highlighting compensation as a pivotal factor in employee retention.
4.	Age-Specific Attrition Trends: The 26-35 age group showed elevated attrition rates, indicating potential aspirations for career progression or change.
5.	Educational Backgrounds: Employees with life science backgrounds had higher attrition rates compared to those in marketing or technical fields, suggesting career-job mismatches.
6.	Overall Attrition Insights: An overall attrition rate of 16%, an average age of 37 among those leaving, and an average tenure of 7.01 years offered a snapshot of workforce stability with room for improvement.
7.	HR Department Gender Equality in Attrition: An equal attrition rate among genders within the HR department posed interesting questions about internal dynamics.
8.	Job Satisfaction Paradox: The association of higher job satisfaction levels with higher attrition rates challenges conventional beliefs about employee engagement and retention.
Learning Outcomes and Future Directions
This project not only enhanced my analytical skills but also provided deep insights into the complex nature of employee attrition. It underscored the importance of nuanced, data-driven approaches to HR practices and the need for continuous learning and adaptation in addressing workforce challenges.
While the findings are based on an analysis of publicly available data, and thus may require further validation in specific organizational contexts, they serve as a foundation for future investigations into employee retention strategies. The project highlights the potential for data analytics to inform more effective HR policies and practices, making a compelling case for the integration of analytical tools in HR decision-making processes.
As a learning project, this endeavor has been instrumental in developing my capability to translate data into actionable business insights, preparing me for further explorations in the field of data analytics and its application in various business domains.
